Things to do:
------------

*Any attempt to kill the goblin without the sword will result in the player dying.

*Add a "cave" with the entrance east of the goblin.
    *A series of rooms in a maze-like pattern that all have the same description, e.g. "You stumble about in the darkness."
    *Only have descriptions of what's around you if player has a light source
    *Have a cave room where you fall to your death if you're doing it blind, make this room avoidable to get through the cave
    *The cave needs an exit to a different area.
*Hide sword after drinking alcohol

*Add more "detail" to the world by adding more things to look at
*More commands like "take a nap"
*More sarcasm
*Add more colour to different types of text
